# Dvorak Shortcut Fix

*Used https://github.com/Ste4s/DvEnEnhancement as template.*

This [Chrome web extension]() enhances Dvorak keyboard shortcut support when browsing the web. 

It's a small improvement for a tiny subset of web users: Dvorak keyboardists who want to use standard keyboard shortcuts, which currently do not work as expected in many websites:

- Press Ctrl+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+I (Mac): toggle italic text
- Press Ctrl+U (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+U (Mac): toggle underlined text

This extension addresses a very specific JavaScript keyboard event issue in the unlikely event that you're using the web with a Dvorak keyboard and using shortcuts.
